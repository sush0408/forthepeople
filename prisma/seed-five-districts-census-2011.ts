/**
 * Census 2011 baseline for 5 active districts currently lacking
 * DemographicProfile Census 2011 data:
 *   Chennai (Tamil Nadu)
 *   Kolkata (West Bengal)
 *   Mumbai (Maharashtra) — Mumbai City only, see notes
 *   Hyderabad (Telangana, was Andhra Pradesh pre-2014)
 *   Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh)
 *
 * SOURCE:
 *   Census of India 2011, Primary Census Abstract (PCA).
 *   Cross-verified from censusindia.co.in district pages + Wikipedia +
 *   census2011.co.in district pages (all secondary sources of Census
 *   PCA data).
 *
 * SCOPE:
 *   Fields seeded: totalPopulation, male/femalePopulation, sex ratios
 *   (total + child), literacy rates (total + male + female), urbanPct,
 *   area, density, caste (SC/ST/Other).
 *   NOT seeded per-district: religion (Census Table C-01 not retrieved),
 *   age bands (Census Table C-13 not retrieved), language, migration.
 *   These are Phase 2 expansions.
 *
 * MUMBAI SLUG NOTE:
 *   DB slug 'mumbai' currently represents the combined Greater Mumbai
 *   area = Mumbai City district (Census code 27022, pop 3,085,411,
 *   area 157 km²) + Mumbai Suburban district (Census code 27023, pop
 *   9,356,962, area 446 km²). Values seeded here are aggregates of both.
 *   This matches the user mental model of "Mumbai" and the existing
 *   PopulationHistory row (12,442,373). When DB hierarchy is expanded
 *   to add mumbai-suburban as a separate district, this row should be
 *   split back into two rows using the per-district PCA values.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT.
